# CityLAB Pixelwelt 

This map shows the CityLAB Berlin as a pixel world and is mentioned to be its digital twin.
The map was ist based on the starter kit of [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

**To visit the map and chat with others follow the [Link to the CityLAB Pixelwelt](https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/technologiestiftung.github.io/pixelwelt/map.json)**

## How To aka. Getting Started

In order to build your own map for WorkAdventure, you need:

- the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software
- "tiles" (i.e. images) to create your map (this starter kit provides a good default tileset for offices)
- a web-server to serve your map (this starter kit proposes to use Github static pages as a web-server which is both free and performant)

On the [Github repository page](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure-map-starter-kit),
click the **"Use this template"** button. You will be prompted to enter a repository name for your map. Follow their instructions to create your very own map.

## More coming soon...
